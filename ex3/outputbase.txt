 

Our last argummt is how we want to approximate the
contour. We use cv2.CllAIN_APPRDX,SIHPLE to compress
horizontal, venical, and diagonal segments into their end-
points only. This saves both computation and memory. if
we muted all the points along the contour, without com-
pression, we can pass in cv2.Cl-1AIN_APPRUX_NUNE; however,
be very sparing when using this function. Retrieving all
points along a contour is often unnecessary and is wasteful

of resources
